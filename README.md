# Gradient descent methods 

## Linear data

Used this video by "Endless engineering" to help me.
Random, linear data was generated, and stochastic and batch methods were used to minimise the cost function. Batch worked pretty well, because the data size was relatively small.

## Air gap data

I used the linear data methods to some Hyperlink data (Hyperlink is an enigneering society I'm part of). I applied gradient of descent to find the local minima of our "air gap" data, but we don't have enough of said data to reach any viable conclusion, it just ouputs a bunch of gibberish.
